# LearnGlish

## This is CS50 final project for Harvard University created by Oleksandr Volkov

### LearnGlish is a modern, dynamic and flexible tool for learning English.

With this website, you can easily and quickly customize the study of English words and phrases.

Almost everyone knows and has been scientifically proven that learning a foreign language does not begin with grammar but with expanding the vocabulary, and only then comes grammar and spelling.

Many modern technologies and frameworks were used to write this project, such as:

- **Python (Flask)** - as the main tool for creating a web application in the programming language Python. Used to write a backend, most of the logic of the website is written on it.
- **JavaScript (JQuery)** - was used as an additional tool for fast and dynamic access to program objects and retrieving data from the server without reloading the page.
- **Bootstrap** - powerful tool for using ready-made solutions for visual components. The project used such components as forms, buttons, navigation panel, etc. And also for responsive on different screens (desktop, tablet and mobile).
- **HTML** - used to indicate the structure of elements on the website.
- **CSS** - used to stylize custom objects in the project.
- **SQLite3 (SQLAlchemy)** - used to create a project database, to store user data. And ORM for convenient work with the database
- **etc ...** -
